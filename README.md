# Navigo
Navigo (web browser) made by myself, following the openclassroom tutorial
<p>Since one dll is too big to get stored on this github, you will find the zip with everything you need to run this exe : https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=6e5962fa-149b-4747-bfb3-3c13acef3fc7 </p>
This web browser can : 
- open and close tabs.
- refresh, go to home, cancel loading.
- go to the specified URL (by pressing return key)
  - without http:// or https://, it will go for a google search.
- set name for each tab according to the website. (for instance, visiting https://www.google.fr/ will set google.
- show the progress of loading.

Here is how does it look like :
